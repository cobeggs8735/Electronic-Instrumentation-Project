# Electronic-Instrumentation-Project
Final project designed for Electronic Instrumentation class (ESET 359) in the Engineering Technology and Industrial Distribution department at Texas A&amp;M University

## Summary
The file, [Project.vi](https://github.com/cobeggs8735/Electronic-Instrumentation-Project/blob/main/Project%20Files/Project.vi), is a LabVIEW Virtual Instrument (VI) file. LabVIEW is a graphical programming environment commonly used for data acquisition, instrument control, and automation, especially in engineering and scientific applications.

Since [Project.vi](https://github.com/cobeggs8735/Electronic-Instrumentation-Project/blob/main/Project%20Files/Project.vi) is a binary file specific to LabVIEW, its internal logic and purpose can't be directly read as plain text in GitHub. To understand exactly what this file does, open it with the LabVIEW software, where you could inspect its block diagram (the program logic) and front panel (the user interface).

This is a final project for an Electronic Instrumentation class. The objective of the project was to interpret the electrical signals from students muscles and use the control signals to operate the Pacman videogame on Google. [Project.vi](https://github.com/cobeggs8735/Electronic-Instrumentation-Project/blob/main/Project%20Files/Project.vi) is used to:

- Acquire and process data from sensors and instruments.
- Display measurement results on a user interface.
- Control external devices.
- Log and analyze data for a lab experiment and engineering demonstration.



If you have LabVIEW installed, you can open [Project.vi](https://github.com/cobeggs8735/Electronic-Instrumentation-Project/blob/main/Project%20Files/Project.vi) to see the specifics of its functionality.

For a demostration of the project file in action, open the [ProjectDemo.mp4](https://github.com/cobeggs8735/Electronic-Instrumentation-Project/blob/main/Project%20Files/ProjectDemo.mp4) file in the Project Files folder.
